Notes:

come up with another word for "invite"

should not be able to send email invitation multiple times - database

add loading ... in searchbox - UI

fix rejecting a friend

could the fact that we pass in the user name through a textbox be hacked?


fix fact that on new buddy addition, we assume they are online


case search - buddy list
	




minimize javascript





DONE:

sync between pending requests and search - adding a pending in search removes/changes the related rows in tables
using first name in chat header and in friends list
adding a friend from search that has sent you a request
added illegal room name checking
confirm that user has not entered blank for chatroom name
had to replace spaces with underscore (not dot) for some funky reason
